Snake Game with LVLM Integration

Overview

This project implements a classic Snake Game where an LVLM (Large Vision Language Model) is used for decision-making. The game involves controlling a snake that moves across the screen, collects food, and grows longer. The goal is to avoid hitting the boundaries or the snake's own body.

In this implementation, we simulate the behavior of the LVLM, which would typically process visual inputs (images) and generate language-based commands like "move left", "move right", "move up", or "move down". This implementation serves as a foundation for incorporating a real LVLM that could analyze the game state visually.

Features:

Classic Snake gameplay with keyboard controls (arrow keys).

Simulation of LVLM-based decision-making using the snake's position, body, and food location.

Includes a feedback mechanism to track the snake's score and game-over conditions.


Requirements

Python 3.x

pygame library


You can install pygame using pip:

pip install pygame

Game Controls

Arrow keys to move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).

'Q' key to quit the game when the game-over screen appears.

'C' key to restart the game from the game-over screen.


How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.


2. Install the required dependencies by running:

pip install pygame


3. Download or clone the repository containing the code.


4. Run the snake_game.py script:

python snake_game.py


5. Enjoy the game! Control the snake with the arrow keys and try to eat as much food as possible without hitting walls or the snake’s own body.



How the Game Works

Game Mechanics

The snake starts in the middle of the screen and is composed of a single segment.

The snake moves in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) and tries to eat the food, which randomly appears on the screen.

Each time the snake eats the food, it grows in length.

The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.


LVLM Integration (Simulated)

In this implementation, a simulated LVLM-based decision-making process is used. The model decides the next move of the snake based on the current state of the game, which includes:

Snake Position: The head and body of the snake.

Food Position: The location of the food item on the screen.


The LVLM-based decision-making function (get_next_move) simulates the behavior of a language model by making decisions based on relative positions of the snake and food. A real LVLM would use image recognition techniques to interpret game frames and generate actions dynamically.

Game Flow

1. Initial Setup: The snake starts at the center of the screen, and a food item appears randomly.


2. Decision-Making: The game state is evaluated by the LVLM (simulated by the get_next_move function) to determine the next move.


3. Game Update: The snake moves according to the LVLM's decision, grows when it eats food, and the game updates the score.


4. Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.



Game State Representation

The game state is represented as a tuple containing:

Snake Position: The current coordinates of the snake's head.

Snake Body: The list of positions that make up the snake's body.

Food Position: The coordinates of the food on the screen.


This state is used to prompt the LVLM to make decisions about the snake's next move.

Code Structure

1. Main Game Loop: The gameLoop_with_LVLM function contains the main game logic. It handles user input, updates the game state, checks for collisions, and updates the screen.
2. Decision Making: The get_next_move function simulates the decision-making process by analyzing the current game state and determining the next move.


3. Display and Game Mechanics: The pygame library is used to display the game window, handle input, and update the screen.


4. Feedback: The game keeps track of the snake's score and ends the game when a collision occurs.

Future Improvements

Integrate a Real LVLM: Currently, the decision-making is simulated. In the future, a real LVLM such as OpenAI’s GPT models or a vision-based model (like CLIP) could be integrated to process visual input and make decisions.

Improve AI Behavior: Instead of simple movement based on food direction, the model could learn optimal strategies, like avoiding corners or predicting the snake’s path.

Add Difficulty Levels: Implement different levels of difficulty, such as increasing snake speed as the score rises.

Enhance Graphics: Use more advanced graphics for the snake and food, and create a more visually appealing game interface.
